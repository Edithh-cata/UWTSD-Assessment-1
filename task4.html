      <h2>Tasks Description</h2>
      <br><br>
        <p>This assessment assesses a variety of skills and competencies in developing a web-based project using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript,
           emphasizing front-end development. The project consists of four main tasks, each focusing on different aspects of web development
            and design, along with creating supplementary materials. It also includes a comprehensive references page to document
             sources and tools used throughout the assessment.
            </p>

        <div class="tasks" id="task1">
          <h3>Task 1: Skills</h3>
          In Task 1, I outlined the different skills required for the project, covering both soft skills
           (such as design thinking and planning) and hard skills (such as coding and technical implementation).
            This task sets the foundation for the entire project, ensuring a clear understanding of the necessary competencies.

            <div class="tasks" id="task2">
          <h3>Task 2: Academic Poster and Mind Map</h3>

          Task 2 involved creating an Academic Poster and a detailed Mind Map.
           The Academic Poster was designed using tools like Photoshop and Illustrator, incorporating SVG images and aligning with the
            university's main color scheme. The Mind Map outlines the project workflow and skill sets. Additionally,
             I developed a web page using HTML and CSS that features an academic background video, focusing on desktop presentation.

          <h3>Task 3: Automatic Referencing Tool</h3>

          In Task 3, I created a GitHub Repository to host the project files, demonstrating proficiency with version control and 
          collaborative coding practices. I also implemented an automatic referencing tool to generate a comprehensive References Page.
           This tool streamlines the citation process, ensuring all sources are properly documented and formatted.
             </div>
           <br><br>

           <div class="tasks" id="task4">
          <h3>Task 4: Description of What I've Done</h3>

          Task 4 required a detailed description of what I've done throughout the project, integrating all previous tasks into a cohesive
           front-end application. This involved refining the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code, ensuring all components work together seamlessly. 
           I also created a final presentation to showcase the project, highlighting key features, design choices, and technical challenges overcome.
          </div>
            <br><br>

            <div class="tasks" id="task5">
           <h3>References Page</h3>

          The References Page compiles all the sources, tools, and libraries used throughout the project, including documentation for HTML,
           CSS, JavaScript, design tools (such as Photoshop and Illustrator), and any SVG images incorporated. The references are managed 
           using the automatic referencing tool developed in Task 3, ensuring a professional and academic standard of citation.
          By completing this assessment, I've demonstrated my ability to manage a comprehensive web development project, from initial 
          planning and design to final implementation and presentation. The use of a Purple theme in line with the university's main color provides a cohesive visual identity throughout the work.
